# BSides Knoxville 2020 Attendee Map
The idea is simple - since we went virtual this year, we were curious. Where are our attendees going to come from, now that our conference isn't physically held in Knoxville, Tenneessee? 

Attendees can drop a pin on the map to show where they're listening from and we can marvel at all the different parts of the world that are tuning in!
